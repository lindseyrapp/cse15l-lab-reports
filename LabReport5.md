<br/>
**Trying Out the Suggestions:** <br/>

This is an attempt at entering two even integers as input. It returned the correct average. Because of this result, I will now try the next commands the TA suggested.

## **Part 3:** <br/>
During weeks 2 and 3, I learned about using methods in servers to edit files using the search bar, which I have never done before. I also learned about the use of private and public keys to gain access to remote servers without having to use a password each time which is very useful.
